## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Grace ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18-year-old aspiring web developer, fresh out of high school and diving headfirst into the world of coding. While I studied computers in high school, Iâ€™m now taking it a step further by learning JavaScript and exploring the vast possibilities of web development.

I'm also picking up German and Frenchâ€”because why not challenge myself even more? Right now, Iâ€™m working on building my portfolio, putting my skills into action as I learn.

Iâ€™m super passionate about growing as a developer, and Iâ€™d love to connect with like-minded people!
